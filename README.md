The Userpedia is an open registry for all Internet users.

[userpedia-website](http://github.com/userpedia/userpedia-website) is a Ruby on Rails application that houses the code for the Userpedia website. While much of the code here is likely to be migrated to distinct service-oriented repos, this app should remain the web frontend of the Userpedia for a while.
